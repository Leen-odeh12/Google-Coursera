diff and patch Cheat Sheet
diff

diff is used to find differences between two files. On its own, itâ€™s a bit hard to use; instead, use it with diff -u to find lines which differ in two files:
diff -u

diff -u is used to compare two files, line by line, and have the differing lines compared side-by-side in the same output. See below:

Patch

Patch is useful for applying file differences. See the below example, which compares two files. The comparison is saved as a .diff file, which is then patched to the original file!
